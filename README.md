The project is a chat web application build with ReactJs as the Frontend, Node and Express for the Backend, RabbitMQ as the Message Broker
and MongoDB as a Database.
To implement it distributed we use docker-compose which helps us to create containers and manage them for us. In this way we can create
replicas and manage the containers with docker compose.
